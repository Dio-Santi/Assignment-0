	I am majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a focus on <em>learning more about Cyber Security</em>. 
        My goals for this course are to gain a better understanding of <strong>coding in general</code> 
        and to better my problem-solving skills. I have prior programming experience in <strong>java</strong> 
        and just now getting introduced to<strong>Python</strong>. My academic plans include pursuing advanced courses in algorithms and data 
        structures, and I am hoping to obtain a bachelor's degree</em> in Computer Science. 
        Career-wise, I have not thought as far as where'd I would like to have as a career in this field.</strong>. 
        Additionally, I have no experience with HTML.
